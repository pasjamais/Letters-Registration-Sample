# Letters-Registration-Sample
Simple client-server interaction using ASP.Net Core web service

The software solution is intended to demonstrate a client-server interaction system for sending (receiving) letters using C# language and MS SQL Server.
The client is a desktop application, the user interface is implemented using WPF technology and the Material Design package. The server part is an application that implements the functions of a web service, created using web ASP.Net Core and EntityFrameworkCore technologies.
When creating the solution, the following assumptions were made:
- the software solution is not a full-fledged mail server and client, but only demonstrates the ability to write to a database when using a client-server architecture, that is, the employee’s “email” field is not a real email;
- the current version does not have a built-in user authentication solution (no middleware method has been added), so the window for sending a message appears from a “third party” or on behalf of the administrator.
